This is a for loop solution, that prints numbers between 100-999 in a descending order
This for loop starts at 999 (let i = 999), iterates as long as i is greater than or equal to 100 (i >= 100), and decrements i by 1 in each iteration (i--). 
Inside the loop, it prints the current value of i to the console
